Heart Disease Prediction:

Built a Logistic Regression model that predicts the presence of heart disease based off of different health indicators. This includes, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, age, etc.

Steps:
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, etc).
- Replaced categorical text values with binary or one-hot encodings
- Scaled variables with MinMaxScaler
- Split dataset into training/testing sets.
- Trained the Logistic Regression model.
- Achieved an accuracy of **86.81%** on the test set.
